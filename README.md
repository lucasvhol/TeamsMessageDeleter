## FAQ

#### Does this delete all messages in the chat?
No, it only deletes your messages, the other users messages will still be visible unless he also runs the script.
#### Can companies still see my messages after the script is loaded?
Yes, [they actually can](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/ediscovery-investigation), it all dependends on how they use some functions of the Office Apps in the organization, so I really recommend not chatting anything problematic on Teams.

<h1 id="title">Microsoft Teams Message Deleter</h1>

<p id="description">The purpose of this script is creating an easy and direct method of mass erasing your messages on the Microsoft Teams app.

And be aware: this script only works on the web version of the Teams app. It does not work on desktop, Windows Store or mobile. </p>

## Features

- Extremely accurate prediction of the messages.
- Works in any browser.

## FAQ

#### Does this delete all messages in the chat?
No, it only deletes your messages, the other users messages will still be visible unless he also runs the script.
#### Can companies still see my messages after the script is loaded?
Yes, [they actually can](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/ediscovery-investigation), it all dependends on how they use some functions of the Office Apps in the organization, so I really recommend not chatting anything problematic on Teams.

## How to use.

Open up the Microsoft Teams chat window in your preffered browser. 

```Open the devtools of your browser.
Go into the "console" tab


Paste the script.js content on the console. 


Run the script.


Wait until it the confirmation that no messages are left.


In case some messages are still appearing, 
try refreshing the page to see if it's a cache related problem or just a visual bug, 
if necessary you may need to run the script more than once.
```
